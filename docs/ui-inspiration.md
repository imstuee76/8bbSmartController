Applied direction in this scaffold:

1. Top-level tab navigation for fast mode switching (Main/Devices/Config).
2. Main dashboard as tile grid for scenes, devices, and info cards.
3. Device management separated from daily-use dashboard controls.
4. Config area includes integrations and display tuning.
5. Touch-first controls with larger hit targets and high-contrast cards.

Next visual pass ideas:

1. Add room/zone filter chips above the Main tile grid.
2. Introduce card size variants (small/medium/wide) for weather/Spotify.
3. Add a quick-actions drawer with house modes (Home/Away/Sleep/Work).
4. Add per-device detail popup with live telemetry and channel sliders.
